    <h2>About Droneshare</h2>
    <p>
    This is the beta release of Droneshare.  Droneshare is a flight viewing and sharing application that works
    with ground control applications to let you share your flight data.  This project is open source, if you would
    like to improve it, it is probably best to start at <a href="https://github.com/diydrones/droneshare/blob/master/WELCOME.md">our github site</a>.

    <h3>Terms of service</h3>
    <p>
    Alas, we haven't written one yet, but we should be getting to this soon.  But in short: this is a beta and the service might have bugs.

    We also use the really cool Doarama project for our movie views, their terms of service are <a href="http://www.doarama.com/terms">here</a>.
